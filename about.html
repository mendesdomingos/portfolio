            <p class="about-paragraph">Driven by a passion for education and fascinated by technology, my name is Daniel and I am on an
                exciting journey to combine these two areas in pursuit of a more innovative and effective educational
                future.

                My passion for education was solidified during my technical course in School Administration, where I had
                the opportunity to experience firsthand the challenges and joys of the school environment. This
                experience awakened in me the desire to contribute to the construction of a more efficient, engaging,
                and 21st century-ready educational system.

                With this vision in mind, I decided to enroll in the Information Systems course. In this course, I seek
                to acquire the technical and practical knowledge necessary to develop innovative solutions that enable
                the transformation of education. I believe that technology has enormous potential to make learning more
                dynamic, personalized, and accessible to everyone.</p>
